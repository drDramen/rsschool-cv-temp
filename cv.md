### Code example:

**[Does my number look big in this?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5287e858c6b5a9678200083c/javascript) from CODEWARS:**  
A _Narcissistic Number_ is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

```Js
function narcissistic(value) {
  let temp = value.toString().split(''),
      sum = 0;

  temp.forEach((elem, index, array) => { sum += elem ** array.length; });

  return sum == value ? true : false;
}
```
